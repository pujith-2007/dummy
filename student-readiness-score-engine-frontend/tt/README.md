# Student Readiness Score Engine - Frontend

An AI-powered platform that assesses student readiness levels, identifies skill gaps, and provides personalized learning recommendations. The frontend is built using a modern, scalable, and type-safe React architecture focused on maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

---

## Tech Stack

### Core

* React 19 — Frontend library
* TypeScript — Type-safe application development
* Vite — Fast development and optimized production builds

### Routing

* TanStack Router — Type-safe client-side routing

### UI & Styling

* Tailwind CSS — Utility-first styling
* Shadcn UI — Reusable component system
* Radix UI — Accessible UI primitives
* Lucide React — Icon library
* Geist — Variable font

### Code Quality

* ESLint — Linting and static analysis

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v20+
* pnpm

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate to the project:

```bash
cd student-readiness-score-engine-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start development server
pnpm build      # Build production bundle
pnpm preview    # Preview production build
pnpm lint       # Run lint checks
```

---

## Architecture

The application follows a **Feature-Based Architecture**.

Each feature owns its:

* Components
* Hooks
* Services
* Store
* Schemas
* Types
* Utilities
* Static Data

This keeps business logic close to the feature it belongs to and prevents the codebase from becoming difficult to maintain as it grows.

### Rule of Thumb

Before creating a file in a root-level directory, ask:

> Will this be used by multiple features?

If yes → place it in a shared/global directory.

If no → keep it inside the feature.

## Development Guidelines

### File Naming

Use **kebab-case** for all files and folders.

Good

```txt
skill-gap-card.tsx
profile-summary.tsx
learning-path.tsx
use-auth.ts
user-service.ts
```

Bad

```txt
SkillGapCard.tsx
ProfileSummary.tsx
LearningPath.tsx
UserService.ts
```

---

### Component Naming

Use **PascalCase** for React components.

```tsx
export function SkillGapCard() {
  return <div>Skill Gap Card</div>;
}
```

---

### Hook Naming

All custom hooks must start with `use`.

```txt
use-auth.ts
use-user-profile.ts
use-skill-analysis.ts
```

---

### Store Naming

```txt
auth-store.ts
theme-store.ts
assessment-store.ts
```

---

### Service Naming

```txt
auth-service.ts
user-service.ts
assessment-service.ts
recommendation-service.ts
```

---

### Schema Naming

```txt
login-schema.ts
profile-schema.ts
assessment-schema.ts
```

---

### API Layer Rules

All API requests must live inside service files.

Good

```ts
export const getProfile = () =>
  api.get("/profile");
```

Avoid API calls directly inside components.

---

### Import Order

```ts
// React
import { useState } from "react";

// Third-party libraries
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// Internal imports
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// Relative imports
import "./styles.css";
```

---

### TypeScript Rules

* Avoid `any`
* Prefer `unknown` when needed
* Use interfaces and types appropriately
* Keep types close to their feature unless shared

---

### Styling Rules

* Use Tailwind CSS first
* Reuse Shadcn UI components
* Avoid inline styles
* Avoid custom CSS unless necessary

---

### Component Rules

* Keep components focused and reusable
* Prefer composition over prop drilling
* Keep business logic outside presentation components

---

### Git Commit Convention

Follow Conventional Commits.

```txt
feat: add skill gap dashboard
fix: resolve assessment validation issue
refactor: simplify recommendation logic
docs: update setup guide
style: format dashboard components
chore: update dependencies
```

---

## Development Principles

* Type Safety First
* Feature-Based Architecture
* Reusable Components
* Accessibility by Default
* Clean Code Practices
* Consistent User Experience
* Performance-Oriented Development
* Maintainability Over Cleverness
* Scalability Over Short-Term Convenience

---

## Pull Request Checklist

Before creating a PR:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Ensure:

* No TypeScript errors
* No linting issues
* Production build succeeds
* New code follows project conventions
* Feature-specific code remains inside its feature directory
